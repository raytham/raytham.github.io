## Updating the Firmware
Get the install ISO
Create a bootable UEFI stick
Create a FAT partition and copy the files over. (The ISO is weird.)
Boot and install with it, but follow the Release Notes to deal with issues
mounting the files.

## Starting the Install
Hold F11 while booting to access the Boot Manager
Select One Shot UEFI boot
Select the USB device that you created with the CentOS install media
